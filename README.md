A. Project Title: 2D Quidditch

B. Team Members: Victor Yu

C. Short Description
- How to play: Move around using the up/down and left/right keys. Press the 'E' key to attack the dementors. You must wait at least 3 seconds to attack consecutively. 
- The purpose of my game is the same as the game Quidditch described in Harry Potter, which is to catch the Golden Snitch and to simultaneously end up with more points than the other team. The other team consists of 5 ghosts/dementors. 2 of them are programmed to follow you and do damage to you. The other 3 move around from goal to goal, scoring 10 points per each goal. You can kill the 2 black dementors that are chasing you, which will earn you 10 points per kill, but you have to carefully balance your time between getting points by killing dementors and chasing the Snitch. Finally, catching the Snitch earns you 150 points and ends the game, at which point whoever has points between you and the other team is declared the winner.

E. External Resources
- The "cloudy background" is a Unity Asset called "Farland Skies - Cloudy Crown." Link here: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/60004
- I used the Snapchat ghost to represent the "dementors."
- The "HP bar" in the bottom left corner was imported from a 2D tutorial project I looked at. I found the asset in the project files located at: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11228
- All of the rest of the animations and design were done by me, mainly through the use of http://www.piskelapp.com

(Optional)
F. Known issues
- If the player is attacked from directly underneath by a dementor, the player may become unable to move or the wrong character animation may occur (which is fixed by just moving again).
